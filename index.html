		      My name is Matt Rosanio, and I'm really excited that you're considering my portfolio! I'm an aspiring programmer
		      with an interest in designing web applications. If you'd like to see what I've made so far, check out my projects list. If you'd
		      like to get in contact with me, there is a contact tab in the navbar. Otherwise, scroll down to learn a little more about me!

			          I grew up in Syracuse, NY. I went to grade school there, and feeling quite comfortable with the area, I decided to go to college
				        there. I ended up getting a degree in engineering. I learned a lot during those four years, but after graduating and doing a
				        little soul searching, I decided that the career path I had chosen wasn't right for me. I started looking into programming while
				        I was searching for a job, and around the time I finished my first project, I knew that it was something I could do for the rest
				        of my life. I've come to Epicodus in the hopes that I can start a career as a programmer, and it already feels like one of the
				        best decisions I've ever made.

		      <h3>Education</h3>
		      <p>
		        I went to Fayetteville-Manlius High School in New York, and graduated to attend Syracuse University. I earned my BS in aerospace
		        engineering during my time there, and figured out a little too late that it wasn't a good fit for me. Currently, I am enrolled in the
		        Epicodus Intro to Programming course in Oregon.

		      <ol>
			      <li>Cashier: Wegmans Groceries, May 2007-April 2013</li>

		      <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
		      <p>
		        I graduated college with a degree in engineering. After I finished up, I started applying for jobs, had several interviews, but had
			      no luck getting hired. Eventually some graduates of the school I went to offered me some consulting work for their startup
			      company. I worked with them for a little while, but I realized that it just wasn't the kind of work I wanted to do. I started looking for avenues into other
			      career paths, and eventually found coding. I learned a bit on my own and made a couple of projects, and found that it was right up my alley.
			      I'm currently learning how to program at Epicodus, and am loving every minute of it!

		      <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
		      <ul>
		        <li><strong>Hiking:</strong> I love the outdoors. I love the fresh air and the sense of space you get from being outside, I love the sounds of
			      the animals and the wind whistling through the trees, and I love the experience of feeling close to nature. Hiking is probably my favorite
			      pastime. My dad and I used to hike several Adirondack mountains every year, and today I continue that tradition by forcing my friends to go on
			      regular hikes with me.</li>
			      <li><strong>Guitar:</strong> I started teaching myself to play guitar around the same time I started teaching myself to code. I've played piano,
			      cello, trumpet and bass, but so far guitar is my favorite instrument. Some of my favorite songs to play are Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd and
			      Pink Bullets by The Shins.</li>
			      <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I'll never forget playing Sonic on the Sega Genesis
			      back when I was a kid. Since learning how to code, it's been interesting looking back and trying to figure out how the logic works in some of my
			      favorite games. One of my aspirations is to design and build my own video game someday.</li>
          </ul>
