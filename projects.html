	      <h1>My HTML and CSS Projects</h1>
		    <p>
		      Our first week at Epicodus was focused around building basic websites. We did this using HTML and CSS, along with a little bit
		      of Bootstrap. It was a good chance to get creative, and learn about the basic building blocks that any web developer has at their
		      disposal. I had a lot of fun making these websites, and I hope you enjoy them!
		    </p>

	      <h2>My First Webpage</h2>
		    <a href="https://github.com/Rosanio/IntroDay2/blob/master/firstpage">View it on Github</a>
		    <p>
		      This was the first webpage I built at Epicodus. There's nothing too fancy here, we just wanted to set up a basic HTML structure,
		      and experiment with different block elements. We later added some inline elements to the page.

	      <h2>Candy's Cooky Cupcakes and Cookies</h2>
		    <a href='https://github.com/Rosanio/CookyCupcakes'>View it on Github</a>
		    <p>
		      We made this project in order to experiment with classes, making it easier to target specific HTML elements we wanted to style. We
		      went a little overboard with the alliteration, but we still ended up with a solid webpage and some interesting fonts.

	      <h2>Blogging Website</h2>
		    <a href="https://github.com/Rosanio/Blog.git">View it on Github</a>
		    <p>
		      The purpose of this website was to learn about using div and span tags to segregate certain section of our pages. The goal was to have
		      a different style for our about me section.
		    </p>

	      <h2>DEVO Webpage</h2>
		    <a href='https://github.com/Rosanio/DEVO.git'>View it on Github</a>
		    <p>
		      I had never heard of DEVO before my pair introduced me to them. They certainly are an interesting group, and I'm glad I got to make a
		      website about them. It was our first time using floats to move the image to the right of the screen, and to make the sidebar. We also
		      applied the box model to some elements to creae a nicer layout.

	      <h2>Animal Shelter</h2>
	      <a href="https://github.com/Rosanio/shelter.git">View it on Github</a>
	      <p>
	        This site was made in an attempt to learn about nested elements and how the most specific css elements will override the stylings of the
		      more general ones. Not surprisingly, no one has yet to adopt Percy the Polar Bear.

	      <h2>Hiking Website</h2>
	      <a href="https://github.com/Rosanio/hiking.git">View it on Github</a>
	      <p>
	        The final website we made for the week (excluding this one of course) was made in bootstrap. The aesthetic quality of this site verses the
		      older ones is noticable. We were able to include several elements through bootstrap which would have otherwise been very difficult to design.
		      We also spent most of the day working on this site, as opposed to others where we had to make multiple sites over the course of one day. All
		      in all, I'm most proud of the way this website turned out.
